OpenFrames Installation Instructions
==========

DEPENDENCIES
==========

--- CMake
--- Info: http://www.cmake.org
--- Currently supported versions: 2.8.11+

*** Installing CMake:

When installing CMake, make sure to select the option to add CMake to the system path. This will allow CMake to be accessed from the command line on Mac/Linux/Windows.


--- OpenSceneGraph (OSG) 
--- Info: http://www.openscenegraph.org
--- Pre-built Binaries: http://www.alphapixel.com/osg/downloads/free-openscenegraph-binary-downloads
--- Currently supported versions: 3.0.1+

*** Obtaining OSG:
You can obtain the OpenSceneGraph libraries in two ways: 
  (1) obtain prebuilt binaries for your system from the AlphaPixel website.
  (2) download the source code for a supported release from the OSG website, and build/install from their instructions.

If you choose to build the source yourself on Windows, make sure that you download the appropriate 3rd Party libraries for your system (also available on the OSG website). For Mac/Linux users, see the note below for restrictions on using prebuilt binaries.


*** Installing OSG on Windows:
Regardless of how you obtain OSG, the end result should be shared libraries and files in folders such as bin/, lib/, etc...

1: Create a user environment variable called "OSG_DIR". Set its value to the root OpenSceneGraph directory (that CONTAINS bin/, lib/, ...). This will be something like "C:\blahblah\OpenSceneGraph".

  - Note that if you already have an "OSG_ROOT" environment variable set to the correct path, then this will suffice. This may be true if you have a pre-existing install of OpenSceneGraph. Make sure that the variable's value is correct.

2: Edit or create the "Path" user environment variable. Set its value to "%OSG_DIR%\bin" (without the quotes). Append to existing value if necessary. This step tells Windows where to find the OSG libraries when you launch an application.


*** Installing OSG on Mac/Linux:
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - The AlphaPixel binaries for OSG3.0.1 do not work on MacOS 10.7 onwards, since they were compiled with the deprecated Carbon framework. On MacOS 10.7+, please download more recent binaries or build from source.
 - OpenFrames currently requires that OpenSceneGraph be built using the X11 windowing system. In CMake, set the OSG_WINDOWING_SYSTEM variable to "X11" before building OpenSceneGraph. This limitation is currently under investigation.

Set the following environment variables in your .bash_profile (or equivalent login script), using appropriate paths for variables in [brackets]. Note that if you built/installed OSG from source, then it is probably installed in /usr/local.

Mac:
     export OSG_DIR=[OpenSceneGraphPath] (may be /usr/local for source builds)
     export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$OSG_DIR/lib
     export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$OSG_DIR/lib/osgPlugins-[OSGversion]
     export DYLD_BIND_AT_LAUNCH

Linux: 
     export OSG_DIR=[OpenSceneGraphPath] (may be /usr/local for source builds)
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$OSG_DIR/lib
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$OSG_DIR/lib/osgPlugins-[OSGversion]


INSTALLING OPENFRAMES
==========

*** Installing OpenFrames on Windows:
1: Run the "configure.bat" script in the root OpenFrames directory. Enter the desired Visual Studio generator name and the desired install location, and all build files will be created in the "build" directory.

2: Go to the "build" directory, and open the OpenFrames.sln file. It will open in your selected version of VisualStudio.

3: Select the appropriate build type (Debug or Release) according to which version of OpenSceneGraph you have installed. If you downloaded OSG, then this will correspond to the version of OSG you downloaded.

4: From the "Build" menu, select "Build Solution". Ensure that there are no build errors.

5: Right-click on the "INSTALL" project and select "Build". This will install OpenFrames in the install directory of your choice.


*** Installing OpenFrames on Mac/Linux:
Open a Terminal window, and change to the OpenFrames root directory (that contains src/, include/, etc)
Run the following commands. When prompted, select a Debug or Release build type according to the version of OpenSceneGraph you have installed.
     > ./configure (enter your desired build type and install location)
     > cd build
     > make
     > make install
This will result in OpenFrames being compiled and installed to your desired install directory. You can then point your environment variables to include these libraries as appropriate:

Mac:
     export OF_DIR=[OpenFramesInstallPath]
     export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$OF_DIR/lib

Linux:
     export OF_DIR=[OpenFramesInstallPath]
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$OF_DIR/lib


TESTING OPENFRAMES
==========

To test OpenFrames, run the various test programs in the [OpenFramesInstallPath]/bin/ directory. You can mess with the associated source code in the OpenFrames/Demos/CPP Test/ directory.
