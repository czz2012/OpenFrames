DEPENDENCIES

--- OpenSceneGraph (OSG) 
--- Info: http://www.openscenegraph.org
--- Pre-built Binaries: http://www.alphapixel.com/osg/downloads/free-openscenegraph-binary-downloads
--- Currently supported versions: 3.0.1, 3.2

Obtaining OSG:
You can obtain the OpenSceneGraph libraries in two ways: 
  (1) obtain prebuilt binaries for your system from the AlphaPixel website
  (2) download the source code for a supported release from the OSG website, and build/install from their instructions
If you choose to build the source yourself on Windows, make sure that you download the appropriate 3rd Party libraries for your system (also available on the OSG website).


Installing OSG on Windows:
Regardless of how you obtain OSG, the end result should be shared libraries and files in folders such as bin/, lib/, etc...

1: Create a user environment variable called "OSG_DIR" (an existing OSG_ROOT variable will suffice). Set its value to the root OpenSceneGraph directory (that CONTAINS bin/, lib/, ...). This will be something like "C:\blahblah\OpenSceneGraph".

2: Edit or create the "Path" user environment variable. Set its value to "%OSG_DIR%\bin" (without the quotes). Append to existing value if necessary. This step tells Windows where to find the OSG libraries when you launch an application.


Installing OSG on Mac/Linux:
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - The AlphaPixel binaries for OSG3.0.1 do not work on MacOS 10.7 onwards, since they were compiled with the Carbon framework which is not supported. On MacOS 10.7+, please download more recent binaries or build from source.
 - OpenFrames currently requires that OpenSceneGraph be built using the X11 windowing system. In CMake, set the OSG_WINDOWING_SYSTEM variable to "X11" before building OpenSceneGraph. This limitation is currently under investigation.

Set the following environment variables in your .bash_profile (or equivalent login script), using appropriate paths for variables in [brackets]. Note that if you built/installed OSG from source, then it is probably installed in /usr/local.

Mac:
     export OSG_DIR=[OpenSceneGraphPath] (may be /usr/local for source builds)
     export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$OSG_DIR/lib
     export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$OSG_DIR/lib/osgPlugins-[OSGversion]
     export DYLD_BIND_AT_LAUNCH

Linux: 
     export OSG_DIR=[OpenSceneGraphPath] (may be /usr/local for source builds)
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$OSG_DIR/lib
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$OSG_DIR/lib/osgPlugins-[OSGversion]
